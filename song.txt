Sitting here wasted and wounded
At this old piano
Trying hard to capture
The moment this morning I don't know

'Cause a bottle of Vodka's still lodged in my head
And some blonde gave me nightmares
Think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies
They won't make of me when I'm dead

With an ironclad fist
I wake up and french kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head
While we're talking

About all of the things that I long to believe
About love, the truth, what you mean to me
And the truth is
Baby you're all that I need

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I'll sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses
